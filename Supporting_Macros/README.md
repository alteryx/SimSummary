# About the Simulation Summary Tool

<img src="../SimSummaryIcon.png" width=100 height=100 />



Simulation Summary contains two main components. Firstly, it allows for a visualization of simulated distributions and results from operations on those distributions. Secondly, it allows for visual and quantitative analyses of input vs output variables.

_Note: This tool uses the R tool. Install R and the necessary packages by going to Options > Download Predictive Tools._

### Inputs

There is only 1 input.

1. __D Input__ An alteryx data stream with fields to visualize and analyze.

### Configuration Properties

2. __Select the input fields:__ Fields to analyze for effects on the dependent variables.

### Output

There are 3 outputs.

1. __D Output__ This is data output.
2. __I Output__ Interactive dashboard output.
3. __R Output__ Sensitivity Analysis Report
